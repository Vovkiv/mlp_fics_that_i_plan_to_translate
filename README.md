I'm small, known by no one, random internet user, who having fun translating someone else's work (like, games, software, books/fics) to Ukrainian language (and, sometimes, Russian language).

Open  `mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate.ods`, it is list. (Created with LibreOffice Calc https://www.libreoffice.org/)

If you, for some reasons, want me to translate your fic, write PM here:

https://www.fimfiction.net/user/595939/volkov

Conditions/obligations that I set for the translation:
1. The translation will not be monetized in any way. (That is, I won't include in the translation file a link where you can donate money to me; no "pay here to get the full version of the translation", etc.)
2. The translation will not be used to promote my or anyone else's projects/work. (That is, if I create some cool project and want to promote it, I will in no case do it with the help of translated fics).
3. I will advertise the translation itself somewhere on third-party resources. (That is, I will advertise the translated fanfic on my YouTube page, Discord, etc.).
4. I'll add all the necessary links: link to your fanfiction, link to your fimfiction page, a link to the cover/arts artist (if there any).

Optional details:
1. Do you me to translate/adapt fic title?

`(If YES, and title is possible to translate, i would do that. If NO, it would be same as original. If you didn't answer, i would default to "Yes".)`

2. If the fanfic has a cover, can i use it?

`(If you WON'T specify about permission to use cover, i would default to "NO", so i won't use it at all.)`

And can i edit it, if necessary?

`(By "Edit" i mean, that i can redraw title, maybe add hint that this is Ukrainian translation, use transleted title, etc.
If you ALLOWED to use cover, but DIDN'T specified edit permission, i would default to "No")`

3. [Maybe i will add something else here in future]
