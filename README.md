# I want you to translate my fanfic to Ukrainian language. What should i know and do?
(Here my first translated fic. Check it, to see how everything will look once i finish translating: https://github.com/Vovkiv/donuts-ukr)

(_IMPORTANT:_ Currently, this list only for fics hosted on fimfiction. You can't suggest me fics from other sites/platforms.)

Terms and conditions, that _I_ should follow:
1. The translation will not be monetized in any way. _(I won't include in the translated fic link(s) where you can donate money to me; no "pay here to get the full version of the translation", etc.)_
2. The translation will not be used to promote my or anyone else's projects/work. _(That means, that if I create some cool project and i will want to promote it, I won't place link to it in translated fic, or promote in different way. BUT, i would be ALLOWED to include link to this list in translation repo and/or translation source.)_
3. I will be allowed to advertise the translation itself somewhere on third-party resources/services. _(That means, that I will advertise the translated fanfic on my YouTube page, Discord, etc.)_
4. I will be obligated to add the necessary links: link to your fimfiction page; link to the cover/arts artist (if there any), etc. This apply to repo and for source of  translation.

Terms and condition, that _YOU_ should follow:
1. Don't be ghost. _(Meaning, that don't ignore my PM's that i send to you for something, related to your fanfic.)_
2. Don't abuse you author's rights on me. _(While you can freely request take down at any time for my translation of your fanfic, please, don't do it, unless you have REALLY GOOD reasons for it.)_

And additional info (answers with "/" is what i would pick, in case if you won't answer on question.):
1. Can i translate/adapt title of your fanfic?
   
   /Yes: I would be able to freely translate/adapt title, or just use original title, as i wish.
   
   No: Title in my translation will be in English.

   _Note:_ I strongly suggest you to allow me translate title, it will make my job for adapting jokes/context related to title much easier.
2. Do your fic have cover image?

    Yes:

    No:
   
3. (If you answered "Yes" on question 2) Do you own rights on cover image?

   Yes:

   No:

   _Note:_ If you draw cover yourself, if your friend draw cover and give rights on it to you, you commissioned cover from some artist - it's counts as You **OWN** Rights on cover. If you just took image from somewhere else, that was NOT specififcally made for your fanfic, then it counts as You **DON'T OWN** rights on cover. For example, if you opened someone's deviantart and copied link to art and inserted it as cover (don't matter, if artist give you permission on that or don't).

4. (If you answered "Yes" on question 3) Can i use your cover in my translation?

   /Yes: I also will be able to edit cover image. For example, add translated title to cover, etc.

   No:

   _Note:_ Even if you allowed me to use your owned cover, i still leave rights to use something else for cover, if i choose to.

How much it would cost?

0, zero, nothing.
