# Who are you?
I'm small, known by no one, random internet user, who having fun translating someone else's work (like, games, software, books/fics) to Ukrainian language (and, sometimes, Russian language).
# And what this repo for?
Here, in this repo (https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate), i would host neatly orginised list of fanfics from https://www.fimfiction.net/, that i translated to Ukrainian language. There will be additional info, where you could see how much i translated, where you could get translated materials, status, etc.
# Where is that list and how do i open it?
Open/Download `mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate.ods` https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate/blob/main/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate.ods, to read list.
(Created with LibreOffice Calc https://www.libreoffice.org/, but you should be able to open it with Google docs, Microsoft Office software, maybe even with OnlyOffice https://www.onlyoffice.com)
# What if i found typo and/or have suggestion to make list better?
If you found typo, have suggestion, please, etc about this list (for example, add row with new data), open new issue here: https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate/issues/new
# But what if i want to fix something and/or implement suggestion myself? Can i make Pull/Merge Request?
I don't accept PR/MR, since it's useless to do with LibreOffice files. (No diffs, etc.) Instead, you could:
1. Fork this repo (or download list file https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate/blob/main/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate.ods)
2. Make changes
3. Open new issue (or via email, volkovissocool@gmail.com)
4. Point out what you changed and why, provide link to your fork or list file.
5. If everything fine, i will apply this changes to list, and, if you want to, i will mention you in commit and in list file, as contributor. Or don't, if you don't feel like it.
# I'm fic writer and i want you to translate my fic to Ukrainian language. Can i suggest you my fic to translate?
Sure thing! Drop your PM on my fimfiction profile: https://www.fimfiction.net/user/595939/volkov; or, write email here: volkovissocool@gmail.com; or create new issue https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate/issues/new)

Keep in mind, that currently i make translations only for fimfiction fics. I won't translate fics from different platforms, but, you can still suggest non-fimfiction stuff. Maybe i will create in future different repo, where all non-fimfiction would be listed, so i would add your suggestion there instead.
# Alright, but i want to know what are you going to do with my fic! Maybe you want to resell it on black market!
I won't do such horrible thing, don't worry.

Here list of conditions/obligations that I set for the translation:
1. The translation will not be monetized in any way. (That is, I won't include in the translation file a link where you can donate money to me; no "pay here to get the full version of the translation", etc.)
2. The translation will not be used to promote my or anyone else's projects/work. (That means, that if I create some cool project and i will want to promote it, I won't place link to it in translated fic, or promote in different way.).
3. I will advertise the translation itself somewhere on third-party resources. (That means, that I will advertise the translated fanfic on my YouTube page, Discord, etc.).
4. I'll add all the necessary links: link to your fimfiction; link to your fimfiction profile; link to the cover/arts artist (if there any).

# Seems fair. Is there anything else that you need to know before starting translating my cool fic?
Yes, here optional details, that i would like to know:
1. Do you want me to translate/adapt fic title?

`(If YES, and title is possible to translate, i would do that. If NO, it would be same as original. If you didn't answer, i would default to "Yes".)`

2. If the fanfic has a cover, can i use it?

`(If you WON'T specify about permission to use cover, i would default to "NO", so i won't use it at all. And if you DON'T want me to use your cover, can i at least replace it with different one? If you won't specify, i would default to "No".)`

And can i edit your cover, if necessary?

`(By "Edit" i mean, that i can redraw title, maybe add hint that this is Ukrainian translation, use translated title, etc.
If you ALLOWED me to use your cover, but DIDN'T specify edit permission, i would default to "No".)`

3. [Maybe i will add something else here in future]
# I think i'm alright with all of this. How much this will cost?
0, zero. It will cost you nothing. I do this because i love translating things. But, because of 0 cost, don't expect me to translate your fic as soon as possible, or to finish translating it at all.

# Для україномовних
Якщо ти хочеш, щоб я переклав якийсь фанфік, якого немає у списку, рідною мовою, то створи новий issue тут https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate/issues/new, де треба вказати назву фанфіка, посилання на його fimfic, і посилання на сторінку fimfic автора фанфіка, щоб я міг зв'язатися з ним і обговорити все це. І якщо я отримаю усі необхідні дозволи на переклад, я додам його до списку, а твій нікнейм зможу вписати у лист благодійників (по бажанню, можна і анонімно).
І, так, це репо лише для перекладів з сайту fimfiction https://www.fimfiction.net/, можливо в майбутньому я створю окреме репо для фанфіків з інших ресурсів.

Якщо ж створити новий issue складно або немає акаунта на гітхаб і створювати ти не хочеш, можна і на імейл написати, сюди: volkovissocool@gmail.com
