# Who are you?
I'm small, known by no one, random internet user, who having fun translating someone else's work (like, games, software, books/fics) to Ukrainian language (and, sometimes, Russian language).
# And what this repo for?
Here, in this repo (https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate), i would host neatly orginised list of fanfics from https://www.fimfiction.net/, that i translated to Ukrainian language. There will be additional info, where you could see how much i translated, where you could get translated materials, status, etc.
# Where is that list and how do i open it?
Open/Download `mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate.ods` https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate/blob/main/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate.ods, to read list.
(Created with LibreOffice Calc https://www.libreoffice.org/, but you should be able to open it with Google docs, Microsoft Office software, maybe even with OnlyOffice https://www.onlyoffice.com)
# What if i found typo and/or have suggestion to make list better?
If you found typo, have suggestion, please, etc about this list (for example, add row with new data), open new issue here: https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate/issues/new
# But what if i want to fix something and/or implement suggestion myself? Can i make Pull/Merge Request?
I don't accept PR/MR, since it's useless to do with LibreOffice files. (No diffs, etc.) Instead, you could:
1. Fork this repo (or download list file https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate/blob/main/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate.ods)
2. Make changes
3. Open new issue (or via email, volkovissocool@gmail.com)
4. Point out what you changed and why, provide link to your fork or list file.
5. If everything fine, i will apply this changes to list, and, if you want to, i will mention you in commit and in list file, as contributor. Or don't, if you don't feel like it.
# I'm fic writer and i want you to translate my fic to Ukrainian language. Can i suggest you my fic to translate?
Sure thing! Drop your PM on my fimfiction profile: https://www.fimfiction.net/user/595939/volkov; or, write email here: volkovissocool@gmail.com; or create new issue https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate/issues/new)

Keep in mind, that currently i make translations only for fimfiction fics. I won't translate fics from different platforms, but, you can still suggest non-fimfiction stuff. Maybe i will create in future different repo, where all non-fimfiction would be listed, so i would add your suggestion there instead.
# Alright, but i want to know what are you going to do with my fic! Maybe you want to resell it on black market!
I won't do such horrible thing, don't worry.

Here list of conditions/obligations that I set for the translation:
1. The translation will not be monetized in any way. (That is, I won't include in the translation file a link where you can donate money to me; no "pay here to get the full version of the translation", etc.)
2. The translation will not be used to promote my or anyone else's projects/work. (That means, that if I create some cool project and i will want to promote it, I won't place link to it in translated fic, or promote in different way.).
3. I will advertise the translation itself somewhere on third-party resources. (That means, that I will advertise the translated fanfic on my YouTube page, Discord, etc.).
4. I'll add all the necessary links: link to your fimfiction; link to your fimfiction profile; link to the cover/arts artist (if there any).

# Seems fair. Is there anything else that you need to know before starting translating my cool fic?
Yes, here optional details, that i would like to know:
1. Do you want me to translate/adapt fic title?

`(If YES, and title is possible to translate, i would do that. If NO, it would be same as original. If you didn't answer, i would default to "Yes".)`

2. If the fanfic has a cover, can i use it?

`(If you WON'T specify about permission to use cover, i would default to "NO", so i won't use it at all. And if you DON'T want me to use your cover, can i at least replace it with different one? If you won't specify, i would default to "No".)`

And can i edit your cover, if necessary?

`(By "Edit" i mean, that i can redraw title, maybe add hint that this is Ukrainian translation, use translated title, etc.
If you ALLOWED me to use your cover, but DIDN'T specify edit permission, i would default to "No".)`

3. [Maybe i will add something else here in future]
# I think i'm alright with all of this. How much this will cost?
0, zero. It will cost you nothing. I do this because i love translating things. But, because of 0 cost, don't expect me to translate your fic as soon as possible, or to finish translating it at all.

# Reminder about ghosting or ignoring
Keep in mind, that even when we agreed and i will start translating your fic, i might need some additional info from you after that. Maybe clarification about context, source file for cover image, etc.
So when you would write PM on fimfiction, or email, or issue, i would use it to contact with you.

So, please, don't ghost me or ignore PMs. It's better to write back something like "Sorry, can't answer" or "No" then ignoring.
If you want me to stop translating your fic or you want to take it down, instead of ignoring, please, write back on email, github issue or fimfiction.
See next chapter.
# You make really good translation, people like it! But, i decided that i want to take it down or stop you from translating WIP fic. What should i do?
Don't worry, you could drop PM on https://www.fimfiction.net/user/595939/volkov, email volkovissocool@gmail.com, or create new issue https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate/issues/new and, if possible, specify why you wan to take it down.

Then i would make repo with that fanfic private, so no one will be able to download it here; i would hide (where possible, since some sites doesn't allow deleting stuff, when it was posted for some time) all posts, where i advertised this fic.

Keep in mind, that if someone already downloaded translated fic, i can't to much with that.
And some internet archives (or even google cache) like Wayback Machine might save copy of my repo with translated fic. Not all of them might remove stuff, if you ask them.
# I need to know, how much you already translated for my fanfic! Where i could see it?
Open list https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate/blob/main/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate.ods, found there your fic and look at "Translation completion" col, there you would see percentage.
(I might add more info about that in future)

I count it as it:
1. I take total amount of words in fic
2. Take amout of already translated words
3. Divide translated words to total words in original (translated/total)
4. Get number that represent progress
5. Multiply it by 100
6. get percentage
So, on other words:
Fic have 200 000 words, i translated 20 000.

```
20 00 / 200 000 = 0.1
0.1 * 100 = 10
```
So with 20k translated words, i done 10% of fic with 200k words!
Math!

Or you could simply drop PM here https://www.fimfiction.net/user/595939/volkov, or email, or go to this disscussion: %%%%%. Don't use github issues for that.

# Для україномовних
Якщо ти хочеш, щоб я переклав якийсь фанфік, якого немає у списку, рідною мовою, то створи новий issue тут https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate/issues/new, де треба вказати назву фанфіка, посилання на його fimfiction сторінку, і посилання на сторінку fimfic автора фанфіку, щоб я міг зв'язатися з ним і обговорити усі необхідні деталі. І якщо я отримаю усі необхідні дозволи на переклад, я додам його до списку, а твій нікнейм зможу вписати у лист благодійників (по бажанню, можна і анонімно).
І, так, це репо лише для перекладів з сайту fimfiction https://www.fimfiction.net/, можливо в майбутньому я створю окреме репо для фанфіків з інших ресурсів.

Якщо ж створити новий issue складно або немає акаунта на гітхаб і створювати ти не хочеш, можна і на імейл написати, сюди: volkovissocool@gmail.com
