I'm small, known by no one, random internet user, who having fun translating someone else's work (like, games, software, books/fics) to Ukrainian language (and, sometimes, Russian language).

Open  `mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate.ods`, it is list. (Created with LibreOffice Calc https://www.libreoffice.org/)

If you found typo, have suggestion, please, open new issue here: https://github.com/Vovkiv/mlp_fics_that_i_plan_to_translate/issues/new

I don't accept PR/MR, since it's useless to do with LibreOffice files. (No diffs, etc.) Instead, you could:
1. Fork this repo (or download list file)
2. Make changes
3. Open new issue
4. Point out what you changed and why
5. If everything fine, i will apply this changes to file, and, if you wan to, mention you in commit and in list file, as contributor.

If you, for some reasons, want me to translate your fic, write PM here:

https://www.fimfiction.net/user/595939/volkov

Conditions/obligations that I set for the translation:
1. The translation will not be monetized in any way. (That is, I won't include in the translation file a link where you can donate money to me; no "pay here to get the full version of the translation", etc.)
2. The translation will not be used to promote my or anyone else's projects/work. (That is, if I create some cool project and want to promote it, I will in no case do it with the help of translated fics).
3. I will advertise the translation itself somewhere on third-party resources. (That is, I will advertise the translated fanfic on my YouTube page, Discord, etc.).
4. I'll add all the necessary links: link to your fanfiction, link to your fimfiction page, a link to the cover/arts artist (if there any).

Optional details:
1. Do you me to translate/adapt fic title?

`(If YES, and title is possible to translate, i would do that. If NO, it would be same as original. If you didn't answer, i would default to "Yes".)`

2. If the fanfic has a cover, can i use it?

`(If you WON'T specify about permission to use cover, i would default to "NO", so i won't use it at all.)`

And can i edit it, if necessary?

`(By "Edit" i mean, that i can redraw title, maybe add hint that this is Ukrainian translation, use transleted title, etc.
If you ALLOWED to use cover, but DIDN'T specified edit permission, i would default to "No")`

3. [Maybe i will add something else here in future]
